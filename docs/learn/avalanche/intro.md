# What is Avalanche?

Avalanche is an open-source platform for building decentralized applications in one
interoperable, decentralized, and highly-scalable ecosystem. Powered by a uniquely powerful consensus
mechanism, Avalanche is the first ecosystem designed to accommodate the scale of global finance, with
near-instant transaction finality. 

## Why Choose Avalanche? {#why-choose-avalanche}

### Blazingly Fast

- Avalanche employs the fastest consensus mechanism of any layer1 blockchain. The unique consensus
mechanism enables quick finality and low latency: in less than 2 seconds, your transaction is
effectively processed and verified.

### Infinitely Scalable

- Anywhere from 1,000 to 10,000 transactions are confirmed per second, virtually unimpacted by network
traffic thanks to the resiliency of Avalanche consensus. 
- Avalanche is incredibly energy-efficient and can run easily on consumer-grade hardware.
The entire Avalanche network consumes the same amount of energy as 46 US households, equivalent to
0.0005% of the amount of energy consumed by Bitcoin.

### Elastic Composability

- Developers who build on Avalanche can build application-specific blockchains with complex rulesets
or build on existing private or public subnets in any language. 
- Solidity developers can build on Avalanche's implementation of the EVM straight out-of-the box, or
build their own custom Virtual Machine (VM) for advanced use cases.

### Advanced Security

- Avalanche consensus offers stronger security guarantees well-above the 51% standard of other
networks.
- Permissionless and permissioned custom blockchains deployed as an Avalanche Subnets can include custom
implementations designed to be compliant with legal and jurisdictional considerations.

## Building on Avalanche

### Virtual Machines

Blockchains are defined using the Virtual Machine (VM) framework. VMs are language agnostic and give
developers unmatched levels of flexibility and customization in the deployment of their
applications. Developers can choose to build on existing VMs that provide EVM-compatibility, or
build their own custom VMs in the languages and frameworks of their choice.

### Subnets

Subnets are Avalanche's solution to scaling, and allow Avalanche to scale to create a massive amount
of interoperable Dapps in its ecosystem.

## Technology

### Consensus

Avalanche uses a revolutionary consensus algorithm that is scalable, robust, and energy-efficient.
Avalanche consensus offers stronger security guarantees well-above the 51% standard of other
networks.
