# Subnet Configuration

A Subnet is a network composed of a dynamic subset of Avalanche validators working 
together to achieve consensus on the state of one or more blockchains.
 
This sovereign networks can be customized by setting parameters for:

- [Validator-only communication to create a private Subnet](../nodes/maintain/subnet-configs.md#validatoronly-bool)
- [Consensus](../nodes/maintain/subnet-configs.md#consensus-parameters)
- [Gossip](../nodes/maintain/subnet-configs.md#gossip-configs)

See [here](../nodes/maintain/subnet-configs.md) for more info.

A Subnet can validate one or multiple chains, 
to customize the chains inside a Subnet refer to the following sections:

- [Custom Subnet-EVM Chain](../subnets/customize-a-subnet-evm-chain) 
- [Custom VM Chain](../subnets/introduction-to-vm)
