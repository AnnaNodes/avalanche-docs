# Subnet Configuration

A Subnet is a network composed of a dynamic subset of Avalanche validators working together to 
achieve consensus on the state of one or more blockchains.

This sovereign networks can be customized by setting parameters for:

- [Validator-only communication to create a private Subnet](../nodes/maintain/subnet-configs.md#validatoronly-bool)
- [Consensus](../nodes/maintain/subnet-configs.md#consensus-parameters)
- [Gossip](../nodes/maintain/subnet-configs.md#gossip-configs)

See [here](../nodes/maintain/subnet-configs.md) for more info.

Each of the Chains validated by a Subnet can be customize too. Refer to the following sections:

- [Customize Subnet-EVM Chain](customize-a-subnet-evm-chain)
- [Custom VM Chain](introduction-to-vm)
