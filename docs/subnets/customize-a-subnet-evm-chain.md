# Customize a Subnet EVM Chain

Each of the chains in a subnet can be further customized using chain specific
configuration file. See [here](../nodes/maintain/chain-config-flags.md) for detailed explanation.

A blockchain created by or forked from [Subnet-EVM](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm) can be
customized by utilizing one or more of the following methods:

- [Genesis](../subnets/subnet-evm-genesis-file)
- [Precompile](../subnets/subnet-evm-precompiles)
- [Network Upgrade Configs](../subnets/subnet-evm-network-upgrades)
- [Chain Configs](../subnets/subnet-evm-chain-configs)
